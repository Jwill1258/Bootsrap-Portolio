# Full stack web developer with a certificate from the University of Central Florida Full Stack Dev program. I also have a background in Graphic Design, Operations, and Finance, mostly in regards to how they correlate with maintaining systems and data for compliance, regulation, and advancing efficiency. While working in this realm, I understood I was intrinsically drawn to the process of helping a business grow through backend protocols and discovered a great passion for coding after assisting in the development of a methodology that increase workflow by over 20%. I am excited to bring my knowledge as well as JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, and MySQL skills to the right consumer facing company.
